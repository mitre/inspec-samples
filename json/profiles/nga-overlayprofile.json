Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints\n  preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at\n  a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass\n  the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.\n  The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information\n  is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means\n  may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect.
